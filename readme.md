Welcome to RainMan!

I built this word game as a project to continue sharpening my skills in javascript, vanilla css, and HTML. To play is very simple. Open the HTML file on a web browser and the game will automatically begin. The black dashes at the top of the screen are the letters in the random word the user has been tasked to uncover. Each game gives the user a total of five (5) trys. If the wrong letters are chosen, the story of RainMan will unfold but remember, RainMan's path towards impending doom all depends on the user's incorrect input. 

Whether you win or lose, users can always hit the reset button to fetch a new word.

Enjoy!
